or, clone this in your local engine with `https://github.com/SwiftyProgrammer690/fireworks.git`!

Now that you have the necessary files to work with this project, let's see what it does!

# Using it! ⚒⚒⚒

First at the beginning of your new python file, add `from src.source import *` to load the files for the package! (If that does not work, please use `pwd` and check where you are and `ls` to know where you should go with `cd`)
For now, it only has seven main capabilities, but you can make it better because, after all, this is an open source project!

| `get_org_repositories(org)`  | Get an organizations repos  |

| `get_user(user)` | Get a user profile |
| `get_org(org)` | Get an organizations profile |

| `get_repo_branches(user, repo)` | Gets all the branches of a repository |
